## Hey, I'm Tomer 👋

Senior SDET & AI Integration Lead at **Akamai**, working on the Threat Intelligence team.

I build automation infrastructure that scales (Python, Kubernetes, Argo Workflows) and lead AI integration into engineering workflows - shared toolkits, Context Engineering practices, and agentic coding patterns that turn AI from individual experimentation into team capability.

### What I'm working on

- 🔧 **Automation infrastructure** - Python/Pytest on Kubernetes with Argo Workflows, Kafka, and GitHub Actions
- 🤖 **AI for engineering workflows** - Building systematic approaches to integrate AI into development teams
- 🧪 **RAG systems** - Multi-agent retrieval-augmented generation for document analysis
